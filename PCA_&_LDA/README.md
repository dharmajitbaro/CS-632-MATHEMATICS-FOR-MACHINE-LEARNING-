### Title: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from Scratch

#### Aim: To understand and implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch, and reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.

#### Objectives:
1. generate a synthetic dataset or use a real dataset
2. Center the data by subtracting the mean.
3. Compute the covariance matrix.
4. Sort eigenvectors by eigenvalues to identify principal components.
5. Project the data onto the top principal components.
6. Project the data onto the top principal components.
7. Visualize the results using 2D/1D plots.

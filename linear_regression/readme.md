## Title: To implement Simple Linear Regression from scratch using Python

Dataset Source: Kaggle
Dataset Name: Student Marks Dataset
#### Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/student-marks-dataset

Description of dataset:
The dataset contains the marks of students along with information such as their study time and the number of courses taken.

### Objective of the assignment:

1. Understand the relationship between **study time** (independent variable) and **marks** (dependent variable).
2. Implement simple linear regression from scratch using Python, without using libraries like `sklearn`.
3. Train the model using **gradient descent** to find the best-fitting line (`y = mx + c`).
4. Minimize prediction error using **loss functions** such as **RSS (Residual Sum of Squares)** and **RMS (Root Mean Squared Error)**.
5. Visualize the data with a **scatter plot** and the **learned regression line**.
6. Predict marks for new study times using the trained model.
7. Evaluate model performance by calculating error metrics like **RSS** and **RMS**.
